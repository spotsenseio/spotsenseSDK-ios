#  SpotSense SDK
## Requirements
* iOS 11+
* Swift 4.2+

## Getting Started
### Create an App
1. Create an app in the [SpotSense Dashboard](http://dashboard.spotsense.io)
2. Download the SpotSense SDK
    Download the SpotSenseSDK via GitHub or CocoaPods by doing the following

    1. Create an XCode Project

    2. In Terminal, navigate to the Xcode project directory

    3. Create a PodFile by running `pod init`

    4. Open PodFile in Xcode or a Text Editor

    5. Add the following code to your PodFile:
    ```
    target 'your-app' do
        # Pods for your-app
        pod 'SpotSense'
    end
    ```
    6. Run `pod install`

    7. Open your app's `.xcworkspace` file to launch Xcode
    
3. `import spotsense` and initialize SpotSense with Client ID and Secret from the Dashboard
```swift
import SpotSense

class ViewController: UIViewController, CLLocationManagerDelegate, SpotSenseDelegate {

let spotsense = SpotSense(clientID: "client-id", clientSecret: "client-secret")

}
```

4. Ask to use a user's location and add delegates to handle location updates
Note: Apple requires developers to add a description of why they are using a users location to Info.plist

```swift

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // get notification permission, only required if sending notifications with SpotSense
    notificationCenter.requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound]) { (granted, error) in
        spotsense.notificationStatus(enabled: granted);
        }
            // get location permissions for spotsense
            spotsense.locationManager?.delegate = self
            spotsense.locationManager?.activityType = .automotiveNavigation
            spotsense.locationManager?.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters
            spotsense.locationManager?.distanceFilter = 5.0
            spotsense.locationManager?.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
            spotsense.locationManager?.startUpdatingLocation()
            spotsense.delegate = self; // attach spotsense delegate to self
            
    if (CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus() == .authorizedAlways || CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus() == .authorizedWhenInUse) {
        if CLLocationManager.isMonitoringAvailable(for: CLCircularRegion.self) { // Make sure region monitoring is supported.
      
        }
    }
    spotsense.delegate = self; // attach spotsense delegate to self

}

 func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didEnterRegion region: CLRegion) {

     //Will Notify Enter event to dashboard for specific region
     spotsense.handleRegionState(region: region, state: .inside)
 }
     
 func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didExitRegion region: CLRegion) {
     
     //Will Notify Exit event to dashboard for specific region
     spotsense.handleRegionState(region: region, state: .outside)
 }
 
  func didFindBeacon(beaconScanner: SpotSense, beaconInfo: BeaconInfo, data: NSDictionary) {
     
     //Will Notify Enter event to dashboard for specific beacon
     spotsense.handleBeaconEnterState(beaconScanner: beaconScanner, beaconInfo: beaconInfo, data: data)
  }
  
 func didLoseBeacon(beaconScanner: SpotSense, beaconInfo: BeaconInfo, data: NSDictionary) {
     
      //Will Notify Exit event to dashboard for specific beacon
     spotsense.handleBeaconExitState(beaconScanner: beaconScanner, beaconInfo: beaconInfo, data: data)
  }
 
 func ruleDidTrigger(response: NotifyResponse, ruleID: String) {
     
 }
 
 func didUpdateBeacon(beaconScanner: SpotSense, beaconInfo: BeaconInfo, data: NSDictionary) {
     
 }
 
 func didObserveURLBeacon(beaconScanner: SpotSense, URL: NSURL, RSSI: Int) {
     
 }
  
```
## Remember to ask for your users location and bluetooth permissions by adding;

NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription
NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription

and explainations to your info.plist e.g $(PRODUCT_NAME) Uses bluetooth to trigger games at certain locations

---

5. Select your new app and create a geofence or beacon in the SpotSense Dashboard

6. Test your proximity event out in the real world or in the iOS Simulator!
